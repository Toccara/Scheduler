Workday Scheduler 

The page automatically loads to the current time and date each time that you access it. 

The Workday Scheduler application is designed to keep anyone with a busy schedule organized, punctual, and on task during their workday. 

The time blocks are set to track/record workload or reminders hourly and the color changes based on whether the time is the past, present, or future. 

After selecting the save button, the information input in the time blocks still saves after selecting refresh and leaving the webpage so that you can access it again later.
